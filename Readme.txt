Individual Contributions towards the project titled( UrgentCareAI):-

The successful implementation of UrgentCare-AI was made possible through the collaborative efforts of the team. 

Each member played a vital role in different phases of the project:

1)Siddharth Jain and Aditya Mohan initiated the project by conducting the preliminary research and  feasibility study,
 identifying the critical need for an AI-based patient monitoring solution, and laying the conceptual foundation for 
 what would become UrgentCare-AI.

2)Jalaj Siroliya and Suyog Jare led the data collection process, gathering and curating audio, motion, and 
 visual datasets across various environmental conditions to ensure model robustness. They also collaborated on 
 model training, iteratively tuning parameters and optimizing performance on constrained datasets.

3)Suyog Jare further contributed to the deployment of AI models on edge devices, working alongside Aditya Mohan
 to ensure real-time inference and smooth integration with embedded systems such as Nicla Vision and Raspberry Pi Pico.

4)Aditya Mohan and Siddharth Jain were responsible for setting up and managing the MQTT communication pipeline,
 which enabled seamless data transmission and alert delivery between hardware modules and the central monitoring dashboard.

5)Siddharth Jain developed the final inference pipeline, integrating outputs from different modules (audio, IMU, vision) 
 to generate context-aware alerts and logical event detection.

6)Hardware-level debugging and integration were handled by Aditya Mohan and Siddharth Jain, who resolved compatibility issues 
  and ensured reliable functioning across multiple embedded platforms.

7)The project report was collaboratively authored by Aditya Mohan, Suyog Jare, and Siddharth Jain, ensuring detailed
 documentation of the system design, implementation, and results.

8) The presentation (PPT) was designed and developed by Suyog Jare and Jalaj Siroliya, focusing on clear communication
 of technical content and system flow for effective project demonstration.
